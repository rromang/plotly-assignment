# plotly-assignment

This work was made to fulfill the work assigned in the Data Visualization bootcamp.
 
 ### Initial work
 
 The data from the json file was used create the necessary variables to create the initial graphs as well as the function to populate the initial page.
 
 ### Responsive Dropdown
 
 The necessary code was optained to populate the dropdown menu that will be used to pull the sub dictionaty from the main json file dictionary.
 
 ### Metadata
 
 The metada was obtained from the json file and the container filled with the information using the d3 select function.
 
 ### Event listener
 
 The code obtained before to populate the initial landing page was modified to work with the optionChanged function. The index number for the sample_id was used to acquire the correct subdictionary based on the dropdown menu selection.

 ### Gauge Chart

 The code for the gauge chart was modified from the plotly reference site. It was not possible for me to add the text to the divisions, however, the gauge does respond to the event listener and shows the necessary information. Several webpages did gauge by modifying a plotly pie chart. It felt uncessary to do so since plotly already provides for a gauge chart.
